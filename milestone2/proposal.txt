This program is a simulation of a block/ball moving along a surface of a chosen material.
It will show the effects of choosing materials with different coefficients of friction.
The idea is that the user will enter a choice of material for the surface of the bottom
of the window and a speed for the block/ball. Based on the choice of surface and the
resulting coefficient of friction, the block/ball will move until eventually it will stop
as the frictional force will have slowed all of the momentum of the block/ball.

Using the mass and the initial velocity, the program will begin an animation of the object
moving back and forth along the window. As it is moving, and decelerating, there will be 
a plot being created of the position, velocity and acceleration. This will be affected by
the object colliding with the walls on either side as it moves back and forth.
